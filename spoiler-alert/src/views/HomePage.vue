        <h2>Problem:</h2>
        <p>So much food in the world goes to waste from us forgetting when it will expire. It is imperative to stem the waste, and make the solution easy to adopt. There has to be an easier solution than trying to keep in mind of all the contents of our fridges and pantries. After all, who doesn't like saving money and being environmentally conscious with minimal effort?</p>
        <h2>Our Solution: Spoiler Alert</h2>
        <p>The app that will do all the heavy lifting for the user with merely a couple keystrokes from them. Users input the contents and expiration dates of items in their pantries, fridges, and freezers into the app's built-in, intuitive form. The app then updates, allowing the user to see their food items sorted by expiration date in their virtual pantry. The user will then have BOTH their food inventory AND expiration date to help with meal planning and shopping lists. The user will be delighted to see how much they save in food and money every month! Stay tuned for dynamic alerts!!!</p>
